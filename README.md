## Adventure Game

# About
I made this game as the final project for my intro to C++ class. Basically, it's a little text-based dungeon runner, and you want to clear the dungeon and get to the end. 

# Setup
1. Download the adventure_game.cpp file to your machine
2. Open the command prompt from the download location
3. Compile the file by entering `g++ -std=c++17 -Wall Adventure_Game.cpp`
4. Then run the out file with `./a.out `
5. Play the game and have fun!!!
